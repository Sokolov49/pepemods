what this does is it un-randomizes certain elements of gun particles
to put it simply, every particle of muzzle flame is split between:
big, small, large, smoke etc.

by default those effects randomize between eachother sometimes (or often, depending on your luck) not even playing a muzzleflash effect at all, making them less intense

this was probably done for performance reasons or to make it seem more random, but it is 2025 so you should be able to handle it now
also i just like the intensity even if its too overboard

if you use mods like particle massacre or hollywood shootout just drop the contents of the mod's folder inside particlemassacre/shootout folder and replace when asked to
i personally use particle massacre with this
