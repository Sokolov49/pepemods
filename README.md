# repository of (shitty) mods i've made for pepe2
youre probably looking for this:
https://github.com/Sokolov49/pepemods/tree/main/mods%20folder/Improved%20Environments

to download stuff you click on the .zip file and next to the 'view raw' text there will be a teeny tiny download button

the repository isn't complete because i have mods scattered all over my pc and older hard drives
